# Zelda

This a Legend of Zelda Inspired Game. The game itself is not a fully fleshed out game, instead it consists of a series of features that can be used in the creation of a full game. Primarily, it is lacking a story line. 

Here is a description of each file contained within this project outside of existing libraries used:
GameFunctions: Contains the functions used in the game loop including collision detection, input response, game initialization
